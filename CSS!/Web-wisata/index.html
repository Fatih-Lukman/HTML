          On June 30, 2014, Merlin Entertainments announced plans to open a
          Legoland Resort in Nagoya. Construction officially began on April 15,
          2015. With a budget of USD $250 million, construction was implemented
          by Art and Project, TAA Group and Tejix. The nine-hectare (22.24 acre)
          park is located in Nagoya's Minato Ward and contains seven areas. It
          has over 40 attractions and uses approximately 17 million bricks.
          Attractions include Imagination Celebration, completed on March 12,
          2017, and Lego-brick cityscapes of places like Tokyo and Nagoya, which
          were completed on March 17, 2017. On March 27, 2017, a commemorative
          Lego-themed train began running on the Nagoya Rinkai Rapid Transit
          Aonami Line to celebrate the park's opening. The commuter train, named
          Legoland Train, began daily service on the Aonami Line, traveling from
          central Nagoya to the new theme park. Merlin Entertainments announced
          plans to build a Legoland Hotel and a Sea Life aquarium next to the
          park in 2018 to help transform the area into a resort, which was
          expected to cost JPY¥10 billion. On December 1, 2017, Legoland Hotel
          began accepting reservations for its grand opening on April 28, 2018.
          The opening of Sea Life Aquariums was set for April 15, 2018. On
          February 28, 2020, the park was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
          The park reopened on March 23, 2020, with limited services, reduced
          business hours, mask mandates and mandatory temperature checks. Lego
          Ninjago Live, the Observation Tower, Submarine Adventure, The Coral
          Reef buffet, and the Knight's Table restaurant were not in operation.
