        <i>Sasaki Kojirō</i>(佐々木 小次郎; also known as <i>Ganryū Kojirō</i>;
        c. 1585 – April 13, 1612), also known by his fighting name
        <i>Ganryū Kojirō</i>, was a celebrated Japanese swordsman of the late
        Azuchi–Momoyama and early Edo periods. Born in <i>Fukui</i> Prefecture,
        he founded the <i>Ganryū school of swordsmanship</i>, specializing in a
        distinctive long-sword technique most notably the famed
        <i>Tsubame Gaeshi.</i>
        He earned renown across Japan for his flamboyant style and formidable
        skill, reportedly serving as sword instructor to Hosokawa Tadaoki’s
        court. <i>Kojirō</i> is best remembered for his legendary duel against
        <i>Miyamoto Musashi</i> on <i>Ganryū-jima</i> (also called Funashima) on
        13 April 1612, where he was defeated and killed. Despite his loss,
        <i>Kojirō</i> has been revered in Japanese history and culture;
        <i>Musashi</i>
        himself later described <i>Kojirō</i> as the strongest opponent he ever
        faced. Sasaki (right) engages <i>Miyamoto Musashi</i> on the shores of
        <i>Ganryū Island</i>. Woodblock print triptych by

        section may contain irrelevant references to popular culture. Please

        reliable, independent sources. (April 2025) Like most of the well-known
        samurai of his era, <i>Sasaki</i> was depicted in several places: He
        plays a central role in the novel, Musashi, by
        <i>Eiji Yoshikawa.</i> His life is described in a parallel storyline.[4]
        In various film adaptations of his story or that of
        <i>Miyamoto Musashi.</i> For example, in Zoku Miyamoto Musashi: Ichijōji
        no kettō (Samurai 2: Duel at Ichijoji Temple; 1955; Director /
        Screenplay: Hiroshi Inagaki). In the manga Vagabond, he plays a central
        role alongside Musashi and is shown here as deaf. Tachibana Ukyo from
        the computer game Samurai Shodown is modelled after Sasaki, just like
        the character Haōmaru is modelled after Miyamoto Musashi. His signature
        technique is also called Tsubame Gaeshi. In the visual novel and anime
        Fate/stay night, Sasaki also played the role of a minor character. In
        the video game Brave Fencer Musashi, the archrival of the protagonist
        (Musashi) was named after him. In the Pokémon series, the original
        Japanese name for the Flying-type move Aerial Ace is Tsubame Gaeshi.
        Additionally, the anime characters Jessie and James are known in Japan
        as Musashi and Kojirō, respectively. An ōdachi named the "Washing Pole"
        is a weapon attainable by the player in the 2011 action RPG Dark Souls
        and its sequels Dark Souls II and Dark Souls III. In the anime and manga
        <i>"Hajime no Ippo"</i>, a reference to Kojiro is made, and his sword
        movements are repurposed as boxing punches. The first time seen in a
        fight against the protagonist "Ippo Makunouchi" the user of the "flight
        of the swallow" is <i>"Kazuki Sanada".</i>
